# Multimodal Sensor Fusion: Transformer-Based 3D Object Detection Research

This repository contains experimental work building on two prominent 3D object detection frameworks: [TransFusion](https://github.com/XuyangBai/TransFusion) and [FCOS3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d). The goal is to explore multimodal fusion and custom configurations for LiDAR-only, camera-only, and fusion-based object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Branches

- \`main\`: Base repo with original subtree integration
- \`camera-only\`: TransFusion modified for monocular 3D detection
- \`lidar-fusion\`: Custom multimodal fusion modifications and evaluations

## ðŸ“„ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/sdoniger/Thesis.git
   cd Thesis
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies using Conda: 
3. Train or test using a modified branch:
   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout camera-only
   bash experiments/train_camera.sh
   \`\`\`

## ðŸ“Š Results

*Images.* Results compare performance across sensor modalities, including:
- LiDAR-only
- Camera-only
- Sensor fusion

## ðŸ¤– Acknowledgments

Some of the debugging strategies, Git integration workflows, and custom optimization scripts were assisted by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), particularly for:
- Resolving subtree conflicts
- Branching strategies for experimental workflows
- Script and configuration cleanup across FCOS3D and TransFusion modules

This support was instrumental in streamlining the development process and ensuring reproducibility of results.
